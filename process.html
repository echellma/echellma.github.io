            <p class="larger-text">
                At Dapper Doggy, we believe that grooming is not just a service; it's an experience. Our meticulous grooming process is designed to ensure that every dog receives the highest standard of care and attention, leaving them looking and feeling their absolute best. Here's what you can expect during your pet's grooming appointment:
            </p>
            <p class="larger-text">
                1. Pre-Grooming Care:

                Depending on your dog's needs, we may begin with pre-grooming care such as brushing out tangles and     mats, trimming nails, and cleaning ears.
                Our gentle handling techniques and positive reinforcement ensure that your pet remains comfortable and relaxed throughout this process.
            </p>
            <p class="larger-text">
                2. Bathing and Conditioning:

                Next, your dog will enjoy a luxurious bath using premium grooming products selected for their quality and suitability for your pet's skin and coat.
                We'll carefully massage the shampoo into your dog's fur, ensuring thorough cleansing and relaxation, followed by conditioning for added softness and shine.

            </p>

                3. Styling and Grooming:

                With your dog feeling fresh and clean, our skilled groomers will proceed with the styling and grooming process.
                Whether your dog requires a breed-specific haircut, a customized style, or simply a trim and tidy, our groomers will work with precision and expertise to achieve the desired look.
